# Car garage scene
This project is to create the foundation for a garage in a racing game where players can view, customize, and test their cars. 

## Main results
Within the framework of the project, work was carried out to develop the basis for a garage in a racing game. The tasks of integrating content, creating custom shaders, configuring HDRP, and developing a tool for editing car colors in real time were completed. 

The results demonstrate the possibilities of creating high-quality visualization and interactivity in a gaming environment. The integration of our own shaders and HDRP settings allowed us to achieve a high level of realism and cinematography of the image. 

The created car color editing tool adds an interactive customization element, which improves the gaming experience for users.
